## Sample Script

### Intro

Good evening everyone! We are going to go ahead and get started... Hello and welcome to our February edition of SeattleJS! Thanks everyone for coming through. We have a great lineup of speakers for you tonight. But first, we have some housekeeping to go through.

In case you didn't know, tonight's event is hosted by The Collective Seattle. This place is great space to work during the day if you need to get out of house occasionally - you can take a break and do some bouldering on the climbing wall behind you, hop on a Pelaton to get in a work out, or get dinner and drinks after work at High Tide across the way. If this interests or you want to learn more about other events hosted here, check out their website for more info.

Let's get a quick show of hands - who is at SeattleJS for the first time? ... Wow, lot's of new people. Thank you for coming <3. Who has been to at least 1 SeattleJS? ... Who has been to 2 or more? ... Who has been to more than 5? For people who are new here, take a look at these hands.

For our new friends, let's go over a little about our what SeattleJS and our community. For starters, check out our website at seattlejs.com. Here on the homepage, we have latest information about our upcoming events, including the link to get tickets and info about the speakers. Our events are always the second Wednesday of the month, starting around 6/6:30pm. A couple weeks before, we'll update the homepage with information about the location and speakers for the event.

All of our speakers are community members - people like you! I encourage everyone to think about giving a talk. Whether you are veteran speaker or first-time, whether you have some hard-won advice or just discovered some new library or technique you want share, give a talk.

We have two kinds of talk: a lightning talk that is 5-10 minutes where you just give a quick demo of something you've found, or a neat trick you learned, or anything you'd like share. Slides are optional. We also have "full-feature length" talk, and this is your traditional 30 minute talk where you prepare slides or demos and tell share your story. Either way, come to this page to submit your idea and we'll chat about it. If you are unsure if your idea should be a talk, don't worry, it should be. Come talk to one our organizer, like me, Carter, FX, Justin, and we'll be happy to work with you on it.

Where do I do this? Or how do I stay in touch with people I've met at SeattleJS? Or ask the community questions? Join our Discord! At seattlejs.com/join we have links to our Discord, socials, and a form to join our mailing list.

And that's our website, and all I have for you.

### While first speaker gets setup

A little later we are going to "Community announcements". These are announcements where any of you can share things like a tech event going on, or your company is hiring, or a new release of a project you maintain is out. So be thinking about any announcements you have.
