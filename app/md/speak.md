## Submitting an Idea

No matter who you are and what your experience level is, you can give a talk at SeattleJS. 

We accept everything from 5-10 minute lightning talks to ~30 minute presentations. 

If you've learned something new or have some hard-won widsom to share, you'll find SeattleJS a warm and welcoming place to speak.

Fill-out <a target="_blank" href="https://airtable.com/shrkvVTP37PnIqgoN">this form</a> and we'll be in touch!

## Delivering Your Talk

Please plan on being at the venue 30 minutes before doors open so that we can do a tech check. 

Please plan on plugging your laptop directly into an HDMI port and bring an adapter if your laptop doesn't have an HDMI port. 

Lightning talks should be 5 - 10 minutes, and longer talks should not exceed 25 minutes.
